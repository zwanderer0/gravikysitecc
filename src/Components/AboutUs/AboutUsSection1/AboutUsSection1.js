          <h1>Our Story</h1>
          <p>
            Graviky began as an MIT Media Lab experiment when we hacked together
            a tool to capture soot from a burning candle and used the closest
            available solvents - vodka and vegetable oil - to produce a rough
            version of what is now AIR–INK<sup>®</sup>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later, with Heineken, we launched a global art campaign to create awareness
            about climate change. Subsequently, we collaborated with hundreds of artists
            to create a very successful kickstarter campaign.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, we
            are a dedicated team working to change industrial production
            with forays into packaging, apparel printing, and advanced
            materials.
